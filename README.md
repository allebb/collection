This Collection class is an OOP replacement for the traditional array data structure. Much like an array, a collection contains member elements, although these tend to be objects rather than simpler types such as strings and integers.

This library is developed and maintained by myself for various personal projects where I don't want to rely on third-party collection packages for licensing reasons or maintainability etc.

Requirements
------------

This library is developed and tested for PHP 5.3+

This library is unit tested against PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, HHVM and 7.0!
